@brief		Function declarations at the dictionary interface level for the
			flat file store.
@details	These functions are not intended to be used directly. The entry
			point here is the initialization function, which is used to bind
			these functions to a dictionary.

@brief		Creates an instance of a flat file backed dictionary.

@param[in]	key_type
				The category of key used by the dictionary. See @ref ION_KEY_TYPE for more information.
@param[in]	key_size
				The size of the keys used for this dictionary, specified in bytes. It is strongly
				recommended to use a @p sizeof() directive to specify this size to avoid painful problems.
@param[in]	value_size
				Same as above, for values.
@param[in]	dictionary_size
				Designates how many records we buffer in memory. Higher means better overall performance at
				the cost of increased memory usage.
@param[in]	compare
				The function pointer that designates how to compare two keys. This is given by the upper
				dictionary layers.
@param[in]	handler
				The allocated, initialized handler that will be bound to the dictionary instance.
