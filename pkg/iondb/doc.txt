 * @ingroup  pkg
 * @brief    C library providing IonDB

 *
 * # IonDB RIOT package
 *
 * IonDB stores values associated to keys. 
 * You can insert, update, delete and search for keys.
 * It offers different types of dictionaries like an Open Adress Hash Map, Flat File etc.
 * It offers disk based storage out of the box.
 * 
 *
 * For more information, see the [IonDB website](http://iondb.org/) or the github repo wiki.
 *
 * ## Integration
 * 
 * The Iondb library integration is dependant on the vfs layer. 
 * Therefore to save files in a filesystem you have to additionally add a filesysten module to your application.
 * For more information look at the /tests/pkg_iondb tests.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * Add it as a package in your application's Makefile:
 *
 * ```makefile
 * USEPKG += iondb
 * ```
 *
 * The integration of different dictionary types is modular. 
 * By default and at minimum flat_file is used.
 * To additionally use other dictionaries, add them as a module in your application's Makfile:
 * 
 ```makefile
 * USEPKG += iondb
 * USEMODULE += iondb-dictionary-bpptree
 * USEMODULE += iondb-dictionary-linearhash
 * USEMODULE += iondb-dictionary-openaddressfilehash
 * USEMODULE += iondb-dictionary-openaddresshash
 * USEMODULE += iondb-dictionary-skiplist
 * ```
 *
 *
 * Include the iondb master table header in your code:
 *
 * ```c
 * #include "ion_master_table.h"
 * ```
 *
